For the given input text, identify all the definitions and their definition text.
A definition describes or clarifies the meaning of a term. Definitions can be:
1. 'Is-a'
2. 'Part-of'
3. 'Is-not'
4. 'Reference'. If the text contains a reference to where the definition term is defined, identify the definition term, identify the reference as reference, and relationship between the definition term and the reference.

If none is identified, return result as None. Otherwise, return the results in the following format:
```
{
    "definition": [
	{
		"definition_term": "term",
		"definition_text": "text",
		"relationship": "is-a|part-of|is-not|reference",
		"reference": {
			"text": "reference_text",
			"relationship": "is-a|part-of|is-not"
		}
	},
	...
     ]
}
```
Result:
