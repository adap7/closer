Task: Identify all references to documents that can be considered 'law'. A reference document to a legal document mentions or points to an identifiable document (e.g. Regulation, Directive, Standard, Case Law) or parts of a document (e.g. Article, Annex, Appendix).
If the phrase includes a specific unit or a range of units, annotate them separately as distinct entities. Each individual unit or range of units needs to be treated as a standalone unit. Identify ranges as a single unit, including the text that specificies the range.
Identify all non-specific references to the same legislation.
Identify specific references to the same piece of legislation. This also applies to references to sections or subsections.
If multiple terms are used for the same reference, identify all terms.
Generic references, such as 'the law', 'community law', 'contract law', and 'European Union Law', should not be tagged as a reference, as they do not mention or point to a specific document or a part of it.

Example: For the task and the following text - '"dangerous product" shall mean any product which does not meet the definition of "safe product" in (b);'. In this example, '(b)' is a reference, as it points to a specific part of the document that is considered law (all texts are sampled statutory provisions).

If none is identified, return the result as None. Otherwise, return the results in the following format:
Result should be returned in the following format:
{
	"reference": [
		{
			"text": "(b)"
		}
	]
}
Result for the input text:
