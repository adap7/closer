Task: Identify all definition terms and definition text. A definition describes or clarifies the meaning of a term. Do not include the trigger word (e.g. 'is', 'means'). Definitions can take the shape of:
1. 'Is-a' (exhaustive definition)
2. 'Part-of' (include definition)
3. 'Is-not' (negation or exclude definition)
4. 'Reference'. If the text contains a reference to where the definition termin is defined, identify the definition term, identify the reference as reference, and add a relationship between the definition term and the reference.
If there are multiple definition terms that are defined by means of one definition text, identify the terms and relate them them to the definition text.
It is also possible that a definition term can be found in the definition text related to another definition term.
A mere reference is not a definition.
Determining the scope of the applicability of a rule is also not a definition.
The aim of a norm or similar context is also not a definition.
An abbrevation is also not a definition.
Identify the whole text following or preceding the definition term if the term and the text appear in the definitions section of the text.

Example for 'is-a' definition: For the text - “Res judicata is a legal doctrine that bars the re-litigation of a matter that has already been decided by a court.” This is a ‘is-a’ definition, because ‘a legal doctrine that bars the re-litigation of a matter that has already been decided by a court’ describes the characteristics or attributes in order for something to be ‘res judicata’.

Example for 'part-of' definition: For the text - “Additional regulatory measures may include economic oversight measures.” This is a part-of definition, because ‘economic oversight measures’ are one of the parts of ‘additional regulatory measures’.

Example for 'is-not' definition: For the text - “Practice of the profession of lawyer within the meaning of this Directive shall not include the provision of services, which is covered by Directive 77/249/EEC.” This is an ‘is-not’ definitions, because ‘the provision of services, which is covered by Directive 77/249/EEC ‘ describes the characteristics or attributes in order for something to NOT be ‘Practice of the profession of lawyer within the meaning of this Directive’.

Example for 'reference' definition: For the text - ‘The definition of ‘food’ set out in Article 2, point 3 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002’. This is a reference definition, because the definition term ‘food’ is defined in ‘Article 2, point 3 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002’.

Result should be returned in the following format:
{
    "definition": [
	{
		"definition_term": "term",
		"definition_text": "text",
		"relationship": "is-not",
		"reference": {
			"text": "reference_text",
			"relationship": "is-a|part-of|is-not"
		}
	}
     ]
}
Return the result for the input text:
