Identify all definition terms and definition text. A definition describes or clarifies the meaning of a term. Do not include the trigger word (e.g. 'is', 'means'). Definitions can take the shape of:
1. 'Is-a' (exhaustive definition)
2. 'Part-of' (include definition)
3. 'Is-not' (negation or exclude definition)
4. 'Reference'. If the text contains a reference to where the definition termin is defined, identify the definition term, identify the reference as reference, and add a relationship between the definition term and the reference.
If there are multiple definition terms that are defined by means of one definition text, identify the terms and relate them them to the definition text.
It is also possible that a definition term can be found in the definition text related to another definition term.
A mere reference is not a definition.
Determining the scope of the applicability of a rule is also not a definition.
The aim of a norm or similar context is also not a definition.
An abbrevation is also not a definition.
Identify the whole text following or preceding the definition term if the term and the text appear in the definitions section of the text.
If none is identified, return result as None. Otherwise, return the results in the following format:
```
{
    "definition": [
	{
		"definition_term": "term",
		"definition_text": "text",
		"relationship": "is-a|part-of|is-not|reference",
		"reference": {
			"text": "reference_text",
			"relationship": "is-a|part-of|is-not"
		}
	},
	...
     ]
}
```
