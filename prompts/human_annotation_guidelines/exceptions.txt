Identify all exceptions. An exception is a statement that is made to allow certain things to be done or certain circumstances to exist that would normally or otherwise be forbidden or disallowed. An exception can be regarded as a negative condition which, if satisfied, means the norm does not come inot force.
If none is identified, return None as result. Otherwise, return the results in the following format:
```
{
	{
		"exception": "exception text",
		"start_offset": 'starting position of the exception in the text',
		"end_offset": 'ending position of the exception in the text'
	},
	...
}
```
