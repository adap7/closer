You are an expert in IF-THEN statements.

Identify, if present, all IF-THEN statements with its corresponding IF (condition) and THEN (consequence) parts. Specify whether the IF and THEN statements concern a precondition or a postcondition.
Declarative statements may not necessarily be IF-THEN statements unless they explicitly follow the IF-THEN structure.
Multiple IF-THEN statements can be identified where the THEN of one statement is the IF of another IF-THEN statement.
Identify the antecedent (IF) and consequent (THEN) of the IF-THEN statement. If there are multiple IFs or THENs, identify each separately.
Return all information that is necessary to properly understand the identified IFs, THENs, and IF-THENs. Return the results in the following format (example included):
```
{
"if-then-statements":
	[
		{
			'if': 'IF statement',
		 	'then': 'THEN statement'
		},
		...
	]
}
```
Result:
