You are an expert in IF-THEN statements.

Identify, if present, all IF-THEN statements with its corresponding IF (condition) and THEN (consequence) parts. Specify whether the IF and THEN statements concern a precondition or a postcondition.
Declarative statements may not necessarily be IF-THEN statements unless they explicitly follow the IF-THEN structure.
Multiple IF-THEN statements can be identified where the THEN of one statement is the IF of another IF-THEN statement.
Identify the antecedent (IF) and consequent (THEN) of the IF-THEN statement. If there are multiple IFs or THENs, identify each separately.
Return all information that is necessary to properly understand the identified IFs, THENs, and IF-THENs. Return the results in the following format (example included):
```
{
"if-then-statements":
	[
		{
			"IF-THEN": {
				"text": "if-then statement",
				"start_offset": ,
				"end_offset":
				"IF": {
					"text": "if",
					"precondition": "yes|no",
					"postcondition": "yes|no",
					"start_offset": ,
					"end_offset":
				},
				"THEN": {
					"text": "then",
					"precondition": "yes|no",
					"postcondition": "yes|no",
					"start_offset": ,
					"end_offset":
				}
			},
			...
		},
	]
}
