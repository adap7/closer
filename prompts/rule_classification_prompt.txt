Split the text into paragraphs. If the text consists of one paragraph, that is considered a paragraph as well. Then, for each paragraph, perform classification into the following categories [Continuation (1 if continuation, 0 if not), Consequence (1 if consequence, 0 if not), Definition (if definition 1, 0 if not)]. The paragraph can be classified into more than one category. If the paragraph is definition, indicate for each definition - its term and definition. In addition, also categorise the rule into one of these categories [Inference, Constitutive, Regulatory]. For this task, consider the following context -
- A definition describes or clarifies the meaning of a term.
- A continuation is a subsequent action or statement that follows a previous statement. A continuation can be used to express a sequence of actions or to provide additional information or clarification.
- A consequence is to stipulate effects that follows from a previous statement. It is an effect or outcome of a rule, action or decision.
- Inference rules describe how new information can be inferred from existing information.
- A constitutive rule outlines requirements or describes how something is made or done (not what that something is, like in a definition, or what needs to be done or is required to be done, like under a regulatory rule).
- Regulatory rules describe how the system is supposed to operate and the constraints that must be followed.
